## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to animate image on hover even though it's not perfect it does work. Other than that this challenge wasn't all that hard.


### Continued development

I would love to learn CSS animations in detail, I just scratched the surface of what's possible with this project.
